            <p>Incredibly flavorful, hearty vegan lasagna made with 10 ingredients! Tender lasagna noodles are layered with Macadamia Nut Ricotta and tempeh-infused marinara sauce!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>SAUCE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Tbsp avocado or olive oil</li>
                <li>8 oz tempeh*, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp coconut aminos (or sub tamari or vegan worcestershire sauce, but slightly reduce amount)</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp fennel seed (optional)</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flake (optional)</li>
                <li>2 (25-oz) jars favorite marinara sauce (or DIY*)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>CHEESE</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 ¼ cups raw macadamia nuts (or raw cashews, soaked for 1 hour in hot water, then drained)</li>
                <li>3 ½ Tbsp lemon juice</li>
                <li>4 Tbsp nutritional yeast (plus more to taste)</li>
                <li>3/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/3 scant tsp sea salt</li>
                <li>1/3 - 3/4 cup water</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>NOODLES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 box lasagna noodles</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>FOR SERVING</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Vegan Parmesan Cheese</li>
                <li>Fresh herbs (such as Basil or Parsley)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
             <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Set out a large baking dish (9-13 inch or similar size) and lightly grease.</li>
                <li>Begin by preparing/warming your sauce. Heat a large pot or rimmed 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and tempeh (or mushrooms — we used a mixture of both) and begin sautéing, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add coconut aminos (or worcestershire sauce), fennel (optional), and red pepper flake (optional) and continue sautéing for another 5 minutes. The mixture should be golden brown and well cooked.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, if using noodles that require boiling, bring a large pot of water to a boil (otherwise skip this step). Once boiling, add a healthy pinch of salt and your lasagna noodles (or other pasta shape). Cook according to package instructions to achieve an al dente texture — tender with a little bite. Then drain and set aside. Optional: Drizzle pasta with a little oil to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>To the tempeh and/or mushrooms: Add your marinara sauce and stir to combine. Cook on low for about 5 minutes to marry the flavors. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding salt to taste or red pepper flake for heat. Turn off heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>Next, make your "cheese." Add macadamia nuts (or sub soaked cashews) to a food processor or a high-speed blender along with lemon juice, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and sea salt and mix/blend into a loose paste.</li>
                <li>Add lesser amount of water (1/3 cup or 60 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Continue mixing, scraping down sides as needed. Then add more water — 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time — until a thick paste forms. I find I get the best texture results with a food processor, but a blender can work, too. It just generally requires more scraping and more liquid. For texture, you are looking for a thick, spreadable soft “cheese.”</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor, salt for saltiness, lemon juice for acidity/brightness, or garlic powder for garlic flavor. Blend again to combine.</li>
                <li>To begin assembly, add a thin layer of marinara sauce to your baking dish. Spread to ensure even distribution. Then add a layer of the cooked pasta noodles (or uncooked noodles if using no-boil). Top with 1/3 of your cheese mixture and spread into an even layer.</li>
                <li>Add another layer of marinara sauce and use a spoon to spread over the cheese layer to coat. Then add another layer of noodles. Top with 1/3 of the cheese and spread into an even layer.</li>
                <li>Add another layer of marinara sauce and spread into an even layer. Then top with another layer of noodles and remaining 1/3 of the cheese, and spread into an even layer. Top with another layer of marinara sauce and spread into an even layer.</li>
                <li>Top with another layer of noodles and top with remaining sauce. Optional: Top with a sprinkle of vegan parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Transfer to the middle rack of your preheated oven and bake for 40-45 minutes uncovered, or until the sauce is bubbly and/or the edges are browned.</li>
                <li>Carefully remove from the oven and let cool 5-10 minutes before serving. Then slice, serve, and enjoy. We recommend garnishing with additional vegan parmesan cheese and fresh chopped basil or parsley.</li>
